# My Personal Website
- Created with the React framework, this website is a visual representation of my resume but with more information and more project samples.
- The Frontend projects are pulled from my Netlify hosting site using an API
 - The live version can be seen by simply clicking on the projects and the link to the GitHub are available on my Frontend Mentor Profile
